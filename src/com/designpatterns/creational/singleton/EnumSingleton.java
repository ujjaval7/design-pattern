 * 
 * To overcome this situation with Reflection, Joshua Bloch suggests the use of
 * enum to implement the singleton design pattern as Java ensures that any enum
 * value is instantiated only once in a Java program. Since Java Enum values are
 * globally accessible, so is the singleton. The drawback is that the enum type
 * is somewhat inflexible (for example, it does not allow lazy initialization).
