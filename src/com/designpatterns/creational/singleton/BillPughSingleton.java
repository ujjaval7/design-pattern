/**
 * 
 * Prior to Java 5, the Java memory model had a lot of issues, and the previous
 * approaches used to fail in certain scenarios where too many threads tried to
 * get the instance of the singleton class simultaneously. So Bill Pugh came up
 * with a different approach to create the singleton class using an inner static
 * helper class. Here is an example of the Bill Pugh Singleton implementation:
 */
public class BillPughSingleton {
	private BillPughSingleton() {
	}

	private static class SingletonHelper {
		private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
	}

	/**
	 * 
	 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the
	 * singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is
	 * not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance() method,
	 * this class gets loaded and creates the singleton class instance. This is the
	 * most widely used approach for the singleton class as it doesn’t require
	 * synchronization.
	 */
	public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
		return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
	}
}
